Our code uses functions in Segmentation.py and Reconstruction.py
We developed the code with the data in a separate directory: ../MIA23_Project1_data_test/
If desired, this path can be edited in the top of Segmentation.py.
To run the code:
    1. open the jupyter notebook Project1.ipynb
    2. Scroll to the desired task
    3. Run cell

Task A outputs are saved in the same test folder as the sequence images by default
Task B outputs are saved in the same directory as the script
Task C outputs are saved in the same place as Task A

Note: ffmpeg is required to generate the video for Task B
